He wasn’t taking any risks, and didn’t want his potential customers to do so either: “I want it to be in every single locker room, for every single player to use, and I want them to feel what I felt.”\n\nThat’s when Rewind was born.\n\nHis goal is for athletes to be able to perform better due to the lack of pain, but without the awful side effects he experienced with pain killers. CBD just works differently: if you apply it topically it works on that area, and in an edible or oil format, it takes over your whole neural system, but he explained that the difference is that “you're just in control, in your zone… We use the best CBD that I could have ever taken or put in my body.”\n\nHe’s very much aware of the unfounded stigma that persists in regards to CBD. In regards to that, he assured that he doesn’t “care what people may think about anything that I do. I'm doing this for the right reasons.”\n\nAnd what are those reasons, you may ask yourselves. “Pay it forward to the game,” he provided proudly. “The game gave so much, and for a while I couldn't give back because of my mental state. And now this is my way of giving back to the game. But not only to the game, also to those who might be going through the same situation that I went through. For people in general… I’m going to do something better, to change people’s lives.”\n\nSo that’s the heart of it, really. He finished our conversation with a beautiful sentiment, stating that “The idea of Rewind came from bettering the game, bettering the athletes and bettering people's lives in general, because I knew it wasn't just for athletes. Being able to help the rest of the world, that is a mission for me. I wanted to leave a legacy for my kids. That's something my wife Haley and I talk a lot. Whatever we're doing, we're doing it for them. Our intentions are pure. Whatever we do, it feels big, and it feels impactful.”","size":"1-10","ceo":"","headquarters":"New York, NY","latest_news":"","linkedin_url":"linkedin.com/company/rewind-by-rodney-wallace","point_of_contact":"","id":"319739c6-a003-49b1-b6ca-859745a97f2e","locationUrl":"https://www.bing.com/maps?where=New%20York%2C%20NY%2010013%2C%20US","founded":"2020"}

The name “Atelier86” derives from the French word “Atelier” which loosely translates to English as “workshop” but whose meaning includes an artist’s studio.  In fact, without further clarification, the term Atelier is more likely to refer to an artist’s or an artisan’s studio than, say a welder’s workshop.  “86” refers the to the street location of the salon’s principal location.  Taken together, Atelier86 an informal gathering for artists and cultural figures to hone their craft and get feedback from friends in a salon-type environment.\n\nIn many cases, Atelier86 salons serve as a type of dress rehearsal prior to performance in a larger setting.  Participants experience presentations and artistic performances, often in late stages of development, before being finalized.  Frequently, participants interact with the presenters and may engage in discussions that lead to final artistic decisions.  In all cases, Atelier86 seeks to provide an opportunity for the artist or presenter to explain their work and get feedback from colleagues and interested attendees.  Typically, events include time for both discussion as well as cocktails and hors d’oeuvres.\n\nUltimately, Atelier86 is simply an informal group of people who share a strong interest in artistic and cultural events.  Atelier86 has no organizational affiliations, memberships, subscriptions, sponsorships or other commercial arrangements.  Attendance is complementary and by private invitation only.  Attendees typically include both professional peers of the artist or presenter and others with an interest in the genre.","size":"1-10","ceo":"","headquarters":"","latest_news":"","linkedin_url":"linkedin.com/company/atelier86","point_of_contact":"","id":"790e76f7-ae3f-4720-8a02-eae9d397f976","locationUrl":"https://www.bing.com/maps?where=425%20E%2086th%20St%2C%20New%20York%2C%2010028%2C%20US","founded":"2016"}

Since 2013, IAMA has been a strong supporter of the SF Annual Teachers and Principals Award and has been actively involved with its honorees. We hosted the 83rd Annual Meeting of the United States Mayors Conference in June 2015, and gave a musical reception and guided tours for mayors and families.

Historic preservation is much more than saving old buildings. Modern preservation efforts are about saving the heart of communities, ensuring vibrant, special places full of character. This means looking beyond architecture to what makes historic towns and neighborhoods thrive – actively used historic buildings, healthy businesses, and community gathering spaces being paramount.\n\nThe challenge of balancing preservation with progress is an enduring one. When historic buildings are allowed to deteriorate or are torn down, or when our historic street grid is eliminated, a part of our past disappears forever. When that happens, we lose history that helps us know who we are, and we lose opportunities to live and work in the kinds of interesting and attractive surroundings that older buildings provide.\n\nAs a response to this need, the organization’s board and staff work with residents, businesses, the city planning and zoning departments, and other preservation groups in Jacksonville and Florida to ensure that our history, cultural heritage, and economic viability remain intact. We are proud to be an official partner of the National Trust for Historic Preservation through the Preservation Partners Network. \n\nRAP is proud to be an active supporter of our community's quality of life, bringing educational programming to residents and business owners, working to enhance our parks and streetscapes, and hosting events such as Home Tour, Luminaria and the Riverside Arts Market.","size":"1-10","ceo":"","headquarters":"Jacksonville, Florida","latest_news":"","linkedin_url":"linkedin.com/company/riverside-avondale-preservation","point_of_contact":"","id":"7640709c-505a-4484-b6b6-975dfcb1df26","specialties":"Historic preservation , History , Community Planning, Architecture, Culture, and Event Management","locationUrl":"https://www.bing.com/maps?where=2623%20Herschel%20St%2C%20Jacksonville%2C%20Florida%2032204%2C%20US","founded":"1974"}
